# Internationalization demonstration (I18n)

I held this demonstration for the students in Craft Academy which is a fullstack 12-week bootcamp.

The purpose was to show how to use I18n in a rails application.

We covered:
  - How to use I18n in the view
  - How to add links to choose different languages
  - How to edit a language yml-file

I created a simple rails app and added basic gems.
I also used test driven development to add some content for display purposes
